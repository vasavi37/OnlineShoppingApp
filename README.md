# OnlineShoppingApp
This is a simple Online Shopping App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates a basic e-commerce functionality where users can view available products, add items to their cart, sort products by price, and clear the cart. This project is designed to understand and practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic UI styling.
